# ML in Cybersecurity Lab 2

### Dataset
Download the validation and test datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rs68uH8Xqa4j6UxG53wzD0uyI8347dSq) and store them in the working directory.
The dataset contains images from YouTube Aligned Face Dataset.
We will be using the clean validation data (valid.h5) from cl folder to design the defense and clean test data (test.h5 from cl folder) and sunglasses poisoned test data (bd_test.h5 from bd folder) to evaluate the models.

### Models
The model with a backdoor can be found [here](https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020/tree/master/lab3/models).
Download the files and place them in the working directory. 

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
Place the dataset and model files in the working directory and the code should be ready to run. 
For generating the pruned models, adjust the threshold and run the file. 

### Results
The results are stored in a table format in the pdf. 
The models generated by varying the threshold for drop in accuracy are stored in Models folder.
